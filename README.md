This Tax Calculator application helps users calculate the amount of tax they owe based on their annual income and postal code.  Each postal code is linked to a specific tax calculation method (**Flat Value** or **Flat Rate**),  and the tax is calculated accordingly using predefined rules stored in a SQLite database.
